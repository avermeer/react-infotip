In this story a `<ReactTable>` is used inside an `<Storage>`. In real-world scenarii sticky-notes are often used on tables containing hundreds of rows. They enable users to get a quick glimpse on the details of a row without having to explicitely navigate to a detail screen. They also let them quickly compare two or more rows by putting them side-by-side. Finally, they can also be used as a reminder of things to do or to monitor: when the user navigates to a table page, then the notes they have pinned are displayed.
